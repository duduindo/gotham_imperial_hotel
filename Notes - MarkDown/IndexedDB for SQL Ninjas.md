# IndexedDB for SQL Ninjas

### Cursor

Opening a cursor is a bit like running a:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table;
```

### IDBKeyRange

IDBKeyRange is to the cursor what **WHERE** is to a **SELECT** statement*(declaração)*. Just like `WHERE x = y`


### Index
In SQL, an index is used to pre-index the database by different columns so that querying that table by the value of 
those columns can be done much faster.


### Cursor direction

Similiar to SQL's:

```sql
ORDER BY x DESC
```
